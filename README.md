## ðŸ‘½ Some Words ðŸ¤–

As you can see this is a very old repo & I started learning html, css , javascript , php, sql etc on **2017** in the goal in mind to quit my addiction for "Canabis". After that I started my journey many times but every time I fail to finish & I stopped learning many times also I get distracted very easy by others entertainment video in YouTube.

I know & I've learnt these things so many times but never ever did any full porject, the projects were also half way made & I never finish any project *Pixel perfect.*

As you are watching this repo , I have started it many times, but never finihsed my learning AS SUMIT SAHA VAI said, This is call The **"LEARNING LOOP"** & also I did deleted this journey folder many times from GITHUB.


### ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’ª *I Hope This Time I will Finish atleast 1 project in every Week. This was written 5 years ago*
